                    "system_prompt": "\nSystem Prompt: Financial Visualization Engine\nRole: You are the Financial Visualization Engine responsible for generating charts and graphs for the user's financial data.\n\nCore Directive: When the user requests a chart or graph and does not specify the chart type (e.g., \"Show me the expenses,\" \"Graph the performance\"), you must perform the following two-step analysis to select the most relevant visualization:\n\nStep 1: Analyze the Data Context\nDetermine the primary analytical goal of the data requested by the user. Categorize the request into one of the following financial contexts:\n- Profitability Flow: The user is asking about Net Income, Gross Profit, or the steps from Revenue to the Bottom Line.\n- Comparative Analysis: The user is asking to compare two or more measures (e.g., Actual vs. Budget, This Year vs. Last Year).\n- Composition/Breakdown: The user is asking for the component parts of a large total (e.g., breakdown of COGS, or total Operating Expenses).\n- Time Trend: The user is asking to track a metric over a period (e.g., monthly sales, quarterly spending).\n\nStep 2: Apply Graph Selection Rules\nOnce the context is determined, you MUST consult the \"Graph Decision Matrix\" rules provided below and select the corresponding, appropriate chart type.\n\nConstraint: You are strictly limited to the types of charts specified in the \"Graph Decision Matrix.\" If a request falls outside those defined rules, you must default to the most analytically useful chart for the data provided (e.g., a simple Bar Chart for categorical data).\n\n*** Graph Decision Matrix ***\n\n1. Bar and column charts\n   Usage: Compare values across categories, such as total sales by country or by country and team.\n   Notes: Use column charts when the axis is a date or time; keep legend categories limited to a few items to avoid “barcode” visuals.\n\n2. Line and area charts\n   Usage: Show trends over time, with a date or time on the axis (for example, monthly sales by country).\n   Notes: Avoid using line or area charts when the axis is a non-time “thing” (like product names).\n\n3. Pie and donut charts\n   Usage: Show how a whole is split into parts, such as total sales broken down by product category or by team.\n   Notes: Avoid too many slices, since many small segments turn the chart into a colorful disk that is hard to read.\n\n4. Card visuals (single and multi-row)\n   Usage: Display key metrics (KPIs) such as total sales, total shipments, or this month’s sales.\n   Notes: Always add context (for example, month‑over‑month change).\n\n5. Table and matrix visuals\n   Usage: Provide detailed, granular data views, often as a “deep dive” companion to summary visuals.\n   Notes: Enhance with sorting on important numbers.\n\n6. Scatter (XY) plots and animated scatter plots\n   Usage: Show relationships or spread between two numeric measures (such as shipments vs. total sales by salesperson).\n   Notes: Use the play axis with a date field to animate changes over time.\n\n7. Waterfall charts\n   Usage: Explain how a value changes from one point to another (e.g. positive/negative contributions).\n   Notes: Emphasize how individual components increase or decrease the starting value to reach the final value.\n\nUser Question: Context:\nQ: hi -> A: Hello.

This significant fluctuation raises concerns about supporting long-term fixed cost increases.\n\n| Quarter | Net Margin % |\n|---------|--------------|\n| Q4 2025 | 76.92        |\n| Q3 2025 | 176.77       |\n\n---\n\n**Advisory Analysis:**\n\n**Assessment:** The provided data, although extensive, may not accurately reflect recent performance due to its weekly granularity and long historical span, potentially masking recent variations. The extreme values, such as the high margins and growth rates, suggest data aggregation artifacts that should be interpreted with caution.\n\n**Recommendation:** Proceed with caution; consider increasing long-term fixed costs only if the company's operating margin remains above 30% for at least four consecutive quarters, indicating a stable profitability trend.\n\n**Risk Considerations:** Key risks include cash flow impact from increased fixed costs and potential downside scenarios where profitability declines, affecting the company's ability to sustain these costs.\n\n**Next Steps:** Review the company's financials on a quarterly basis to assess the stability of its profitability metrics, and conduct a detailed cash flow analysis to understand the potential impact of increased fixed costs on the company's financial health.\nQ: Given the current financial data, should the company prioritize hiring more employees or investing in automation? -> A: The company's latest quarter revenue is $35.07B and net income is $25.82B. \n\nGiven the significant net income, investing in automation could be a strategic choice to improve efficiency and reduce long-term costs. \n\n|  Metric  | Value  |\n|----------|---------|\n| Revenue  | $35.07B |\n| Net Income| $25.82B |\n\n---\n\n**Advisory Analysis:**\n\n**Assessment:** The provided data, although impressive, should be viewed with caution due to its weekly granularity and potential aggregation artifacts, which may not accurately reflect recent performance.

The extreme growth and margin values suggest data aggregation artifacts, which should be considered when interpreting the data.\n\n**Recommendation:** If revenue were to decline by 20% over the next two quarters, management should consider reducing costs in tandem to mitigate the impact on profitability, proceeding with cost adjustments if the operating margin stays above 30% for at least one quarter.\n\n**Risk Considerations:** Key risks include cash flow impacts from reduced revenue and potential downsizing costs, which could exacerbate the decline in profitability if not managed carefully.\n\n**Next Steps:** Management should closely monitor quarterly revenue and operating margins, and develop a contingency plan to adjust costs and investments if the revenue decline materializes, reviewing the plan's effectiveness after one quarter.\nQ: Instead of across-the-board salary increases, what compensation strategies could align employee incentives with the company’s financial performance? -> A: To align employee incentives with the company's financial performance, consider a variable compensation plan tied to revenue growth or net income targets. \n\nThe company's recent financial performance (2025):\n| Quarter | Revenue | Net Income |\n|---------|----------|------------|\n| Q4     | $934.95B | $719.19B   |\n| Q3     | $16.43B  | $29.04B    |\n| Q2     | $18.78B  | $24.33B    |\n| Q1     | $15.18B  | $9.76B     |\n\nA plan with tiered bonuses based on achieving specific revenue and net income targets could motivate employees to drive business growth.

Net income for 2025: $10.394B (Q1: $9.761B, Q2: $24.329B, Q3: $29.043B, Q4: $719.189B). \nThe significant increase in Q4 2025 suggests a strong financial performance. \n| Year | Qtr | Net Income |\n|------|-----|------------|\n| 2024 | Q1  | $18.74B    |\n| 2024 | Q2  | $17.218B   |\n| 2024 | Q3  | $25.071B   |\n| 2024 | Q4  | $25.058B   |\n| 2025 | Q1  | $9.761B    |\n| 2025 | Q2  | $24.329B   |\n| 2025 | Q3  | $29.043B   |\n| 2025 | Q4  | $719.189B  | \nSalaries should be increased.\n\n---\n\n**Advisory Analysis:**\n\n**Assessment:** Data distortion is detected due to margins exceeding 100% and extreme growth rates, indicating that the data is not economically meaningful and suggests aggregation artifacts. The provided financial metrics are unreliable for precise calculations due to these anomalies.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given the data quality concerns, it's advisable to exercise caution with significant salary adjustments. Directionally, a stable to modest increase in salaries (0-10% range) could be considered if the company's financial performance stabilizes and shows sustainable growth, but this should be carefully evaluated against the company's cash flow and financial stability.\n\n**Risk Considerations:** Key risks include cash flow volatility, potential downturns in revenue growth, and the sustainability of the current financial performance. Any salary increase decisions should consider these risks and ensure the company can absorb potential downsides.\n\n**Next Steps:** Proceed with caution and closely monitor the company's financial performance over the next two quarters. If revenue growth stabilizes above 20% and net income margins remain above 50% for this period, reconsidering a modest salary increase might be appropriate, contingent upon a thorough review of the company's financial health and risk profile.\nQ: Is the company’s profitability stable enough to support long-term fixed cost increases? -> A: The company's profitability appears unstable due to significant fluctuations in revenue and net income. Revenue grew from $15.18B (Q1 2025) to $934.95B (Q4 2025), while net income grew from $9.76B (Q1 2025) to $719.19B (Q4 2025).\n\n| Quarter | Revenue | Net Income |\n|---------|----------|------------|\n| Q4 2025 | $934.95B | $719.19B  |\n| Q3 2025 | $16.43B  | $29.04B   |\n| Q2 2025 | $18.78B  | $24.33B   |\n| Q1 2025 | $15.18B  | $9.76B    | \n\nLong-term fixed cost increases are uncertain.\n\n---\n\n**Advisory Analysis:**\n\n**Assessment:** Data distortion detected, not economically meaningful, as margins exceeding 100% and extreme growth rates suggest significant data anomalies. The provided financial data is insufficient for precise calculations due to these distortions.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given the data quality concerns, exact projections are unreliable, but directionally, the company's ability to support long-term fixed cost increases is uncertain. If the company can maintain a stable and realistic margin profile, and revenue growth rates normalize, then a moderate increase in fixed costs might be sustainable, potentially in the range of 5-15% of current levels.\n\n**Risk Considerations:** Key risks include cash flow volatility, potential downside scenarios from unsustainable growth rates, and the impact of normalized margins on profitability, which could significantly affect the company's ability to absorb fixed cost increases.\n\n**Next Steps:** Proceed with caution, and monitor the company's financial performance over the next 2-3 quarters to assess the stability of margins and growth rates.

                    "question": "Context:\nQ: Given the current financial data, should the company prioritize hiring more employees or investing in automation? -> A: Given the unstable profitability and significant fluctuations in revenue and net income, prioritizing investing in automation over hiring more employees is recommended. This approach can help manage costs and improve efficiency.\n\nLatest Revenue: $934.95B (Q4 2025)\nNet Income: $719.19B (Q4 2025) \n| Quarter | Revenue | Net Income |\n|---------|----------|------------|\n| Q4 2025 | $934.95B | $719.19B  |\n\n---\n\n**Advisory Analysis:**\n\n**Assessment:** Data distortion detected, not economically meaningful, as margins exceed 100% and growth rates are extremely high, indicating severe data quality issues. The provided data is insufficient for precise calculations due to these anomalies.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given the data quality concerns, exact projections are unreliable, but directionally, the company may consider investing in automation if revenue growth stabilizes above 10% for the next two quarters, as this could indicate sustainable scalability. However, if the growth rate normalizes significantly, prioritizing hiring more employees might be more beneficial to support stabilized growth, potentially in the range of 5-15% increase in workforce.\n\n**Risk Considerations:** Key risks include cash flow impact from significant investments in automation or hiring, potential downside scenarios if growth rates normalize sharply, and the sustainability of current revenue and income levels.\n\n**Next Steps:** Proceed with a thorough data validation and normalization process to ensure accurate financial insights. Meanwhile, develop scenario plans for both automation investment and workforce expansion, triggered by the company's ability to maintain a revenue growth rate above 10% for two consecutive quarters.\nQ: If revenue were to decline by 20% over the next two quarters, how would that impact profitability and what actions should management consider? -> A: A 20% decline in revenue would significantly impact profitability. \nCurrent Revenue: $1.12B, Current Net Income: $1.14B. \nProjected Revenue (20% decline): $0.90B.\n\n| Scenario | Revenue | Net Income |\n|---------|----------|------------|\n| Current  | $1.12B   | $1.14B     |\n| 20% Decline | $0.90B | Not Available | \n\nManagement should consider cost reduction and operational efficiency improvements to mitigate the effects.\n\n---\n\n**Advisory Analysis:**\n\n**Assessment:** Data distortion is detected due to margins exceeding 100%, indicating that the data is not economically meaningful for precise calculations. The provided financial metrics, such as a gross margin of 288.44% and revenue growth of 5590.38%, suggest extreme values that are likely aggregation artifacts.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given the data quality concerns, exact projections are unreliable; however, directionally, a 20% revenue decline would likely have a significant negative impact on profitability, potentially reducing net income substantially. Management should consider cost reduction strategies and explore ways to mitigate the decline in revenue, aiming to maintain profitability within a range of 30-50% of current levels, depending on the effectiveness of their actions.\n\n**Risk Considerations:** Key risks include cash flow constraints, decreased investor confidence, and potential downsizing needs. The significant decline in revenue could also impact the company's ability to sustain its current operations and investments.\n\n**Next Steps:** Management should proceed with caution, closely monitoring revenue and net income trends over the next two quarters. If revenue decline exceeds 25% or net income falls below 50% of current levels for two consecutive quarters, management should reassess their strategy and consider more drastic measures to ensure the company's sustainability.\nUser Query: Instead of across-the-board salary increases, what compensation strategies could align employee incentives with the company’s financial performance?",
